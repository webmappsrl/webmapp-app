<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    - refactor(utils): ‚ôªÔ∏è rename parameter in isValidWmFeature function
    Renamed the parameter `data` to `feature` in the `isValidWmFeature` function to improve code readability and clarity. This change aligns the parameter name with its usage context and makes the function more intuitive for developers.

    - Removed the `changeDetection` strategy to simplify the component configuration. A TODO comment was added for future consideration.
    - Reformatted `_deserializeProperties` method for better readability by breaking long method signatures into multiple lines.
    - Applied similar formatting improvements to the handling of `geojsonFeature` extraction for consistent code style.
    
    - refactor(modal-ugc-uploader): ‚ôªÔ∏è update feature validation and extraction logic
    - Replaced `Feature` import with `FeatureCollection` from 'geojson'.
    - Added `isValidWmFeature` import from '@wm-core/utils/features'.
    - Updated `_deleteUnnecessaryProperties` to retain and assign `owner_id`.
    - Renamed `_deserializeProperties` to `_deserializeKmlProperties`.
    - Removed `_isValidGeoJsonFeature` and moved its logic to `isValidWmFeature`.

    - Created `isValidWmFeature` function in `features.ts` for validating `WmFeature`.
    - Ensures that the feature has a valid type, geometry, and coordinates.
    - TODO: Consider moving this function to `wm-types`.
    
    fix(localForage): üêõ use isValidWmFeature for feature validation
    
    - Updated `saveUgc` function to use `isValidWmFeature` for validation before proceeding.
    - Ensures consistent feature validation across modules.
    
    - refactor(modal-ugc-uploader): ‚ôªÔ∏è consolidate form error handling and save function
    Replaced individual `_addFormError` and `_removeFormError` methods with newly created utility functions `addFormError` and `removeFormError` to streamline form error handling. This enhances code readability and reduces redundancy.
    
    Additionally, refactored the `saveUgcTrack` and `saveUgcPoi` calls into a single `saveUgc` function. This simplifies the logic by consolidating the save operations for different geometry types into one function, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
    
    Refined the process of extracting a GeoJSON feature from parsed GPX or KML content by introducing `_getGeojsonFeature` to minimize repetitive code and improve clarity.
    
    This refactoring aims to make the component code cleaner and more maintainable without altering existing functionalities.

### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

- This update may introduce breaking changes in the codebase due to changes in the @capacitor/device library.

### Features

- add e2e test for orientation and location buttons <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/4989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[4989]</a> ([#94](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/issues/94)) ([fa100bb](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/fa100bb1a533f29d7fff3e5f1b13668ba6440479))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    Added a new e2e test file to test the visualization of the orientation and location buttons. The test verifies that the buttons are displayed correctly on the map page.
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    This commit updates the URL handling logic for the home tab in the tabs page. Now, when the home tab is selected, the current query parameters are cleared and the URL is updated accordingly. This ensures that any previous tracking or point of interest information is removed from the URL.
### Bug Fixes

- Add dynamic title for UGC POI properties in map page ([#74](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/issues/74)) ([f6d70be](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/f6d70be98eb34e8ba276e9d6bfc8eaaef8889c63))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    - Added an *ngIf condition to display the title based on the presence of currentUgcPoiProperties$.
    - The title now shows the name of the UGC POI properties using wmtrans translation.
    
    This commit enhances the map page by dynamically displaying a title for UGC POI properties when available.
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    This commit adds the functionality to go to the home page when the current tab is 'home' and the user clicks on it again. It dispatches the action to navigate to the home page using the `goToHome()` method from `user-activity.action`.
### Miscellaneous

- Add custom Cypress commands and test utilities ([b78c697](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/b78c697d4a7d72f4428d92a757c2ecdf1d2b9213))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    This commit adds a new file `commands.ts` in the `core/cypress/support` directory, which contains custom Cypress commands for login, drag, dismiss, and visit. It also adds a new file `e2e.ts` in the same directory, which imports the `commands.ts` file.
    
    Additionally, this commit introduces a new file `test-utils.ts` in the `core/cypress/utils` directory. This file includes functions for clearing test state, logging into the application, and navigating to different pages.
    
    These changes aim to improve code organization and provide reusable functionality for end-to-end testing.
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    - Added code to display UGC POI properties in the map page HTML template.
    - Updated the TypeScript file to select and subscribe to the current UGC POI properties from the store.
- add e2e test for downloading ec-track <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/4974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[4974]</a> ([#91](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/issues/91)) ([f6b4aa6](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/f6b4aa61b37363fb734564ef1bad94aeab277206))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    * chore: add e2e test for downloading ec-track
    
    This commit adds a new e2e test file `download-ec-track.cy.ts` that tests the functionality of downloading an ec-track. The test verifies that the download button is visible, downloads the track, and checks if the downloaded track is displayed correctly in the downloads section.
    
    The test uses helper functions `getDownloadButton()` and `getGoToDownloadsButton()` to locate and interact with the relevant elements on the page.
    
    These changes aim to ensure that the download feature for ec-tracks is working as expected.
    
    * chore: Update download-ec-track.cy.ts
    
    - Replace hardcoded track name with dynamic data
    - Reduce timeout for 'Go to Downloads' button to improve test performance
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    * chore: Add e2e tests for sharing track and poi <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/4927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[4927]</a>
    
    This commit adds end-to-end tests for sharing a track and a point of interest (poi). The tests ensure that the share button is correctly displayed when selecting a track or poi, and that clicking on the share button opens the share window. The test utils file is also added, which contains helper functions for navigating to the home page, opening layers, pois, and tracks.
    
    * chore: Remove unnecessary wait in share-track-and-poi.cy.ts
    
    The code changes remove the unnecessary wait(1000) statements in the 'Should open share window when click on share button' test case. This improves the efficiency of the test by eliminating unnecessary delays.
