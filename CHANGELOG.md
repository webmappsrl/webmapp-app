* **wm-core:** changelog for bump to 4f49516 ([20a84e0](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/20a84e045ab7b4347e092bce8b683a7d342ceac1))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    - refactor(auth): ‚ôªÔ∏è simplify header logic and remove app_id from privacy
    The auth interceptor has been updated to streamline the header setting logic. The 'Authorization' header is now conditionally added only if the 'idToken' is present. This change simplifies the code and improves readability.
    
    Additionally, the 'app_id' field has been removed from the 'Privacy' interface and related logic in the 'auth.service.ts' file. This reflects a change in how privacy agreements are managed, no longer requiring an 'app_id'.
* **wm-core:** changelog for bump to e84d096 ([8584987](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/85849876a6481fcf22a81c907fb0703af4ab5382))
<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->

    * refactor(icons): ‚ôªÔ∏è convert svg rendering to wm-icon component
    
    Replaced inline SVG rendering logic in multiple components with a reusable `wm-icon` component to streamline icon handling. This change affects several components including `search-box`, `filters`, `select-filter`, `status-filter`, `poi-types-badges`, `tab-howto`, and `track-related-poi`.
    
    - Introduced `wm-icon` component with logic to select and render icons based on data.
    - Removed redundant SVG rendering logic from the affected components.
    - Updated the respective HTML and SCSS files to accommodate the changes.
    - Added `WmIconComponent` to `WmSharedModule`.
    
    These changes aim to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability by centralizing icon rendering logic.
    
    * refactor(conf): ‚ôªÔ∏è remove redundant geohubId check and layer processing
    
    The code checking for `geohubId === 3` and processing map layers for edges and crossroads has been removed. This simplifies the reducer by eliminating unnecessary logic that was specific to a certain geohub configuration. Now, the MAP state update only merges the incoming configuration without additional processing.
* **wm-types:** changelog for bump to 0e8cf6d ([af4855e](https://github.com/webmappsrl/webmapp-app/commit/af4855ed4af8b3d785c4b8f93e4a3f01acd11868))

<!-- COMMIT_DESC -->
    
    * chore(poi): ‚ú® add Point of Interest (POI) recording functionality
    
    This commit introduces the ability to record User Generated Content (UGC) Points of Interest (POI) within the application. Key changes include:
    
    - Creation of a new `PoiRecorderComponent` for recording POIs.
    - Modification of existing track recording components and modules to support POI recording.
    - Removal of the old waypoint page and its related components.
    - Update of localization files to include new translations for POI recording.
    - Adjustment of routing and component architecture to integrate the new POI recording feature seamlessly within the app.
    
    These changes allow users to record and save POIs, enhancing the application's functionality for user-generated map content.
    
    * Updated submodule core/src/app/shared/map-core
    
    * Updated submodule core/src/app/shared/wm-core
    
    * refactor(e2e): ‚ôªÔ∏è use mapReadyTimeout constant for consistency
    
    Updated Cypress e2e tests to use the `mapReadyTimeout` constant instead of hardcoded timeout values. This improves maintainability by centralizing timeout configuration.
    
    - Added `mapReadyTimeout` constant in `test-utils.ts`.
    - Replaced hardcoded timeout values with `mapReadyTimeout` in related test files.
    - Adjusted `appId` in `environment.ts` for configuration consistency.
    
    * fix(e2e): üêõ update selectors for waypoint save button
    
    Updated the Cypress test for the wm-form field to use the correct selectors for the waypoint save button. The previous selectors were outdated and caused test failures. The new selectors ensure that the test accurately reflects the current UI elements.
    
    * style(ui): üíÑ update ion-card positioning with safe area insets
    
    Adjusted the positioning of the `ion-card` in both `poi-recorder.component.ts` and `track-recorder.component.scss` to account for safe area insets. This change ensures proper layout and appearance on devices with notches or other display cutouts by using `env()` for `safe-area-inset-left`, `safe-area-inset-right`, and `safe-area-inset-top`.
    
    * refactor(modal-save): ‚ôªÔ∏è simplify save method with updated device info flow
    
    Removed unnecessary async/await for device information retrieval. Integrated device info into a reactive stream using switchMap to update the `ugcFeature` properties. Ensured modal dismissal logic is reactive and streamlined the subscription handling for dispatching sync actions. This refactor enhances the maintainability and readability of the `save` method.
    
    * refactor(poi-recorder): ‚ôªÔ∏è separate HTML and SCSS from TypeScript component
    
    The template and styles of the poi-recorder component have been moved from the TypeScript file into their respective HTML and SCSS files. This separation improves code organization and maintainability. The HTML content is now located in `poi-recorder.component.html` and the styles in `poi-recorder.component.scss`. The TypeScript component file now references these files using `templateUrl` and `styleUrls`.
    
    * Updated submodule core/src/app/shared/wm-core
    
    * refactor(map): ‚ôªÔ∏è rename wm-recorder to wm-track-recorder
    
    Updated the SCSS to change the class name from `wm-recorder` to `wm-track-recorder` to better reflect its functionality. This change affects both `.onlyTitle` and `.open` sections for consistent naming conventions.
    
    * Updated submodule core/src/app/shared/wm-core
    
    - chore(map): üó∫Ô∏è add focus position and recording panel functionality <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5239]</a> (#130)
    * chore(map): üó∫Ô∏è add focus position and recording panel functionality
    
    Added new functionalities to the geobox map component including focus position and recording panel toggles. Updated HTML to bind new observables for map control parameters. Refactored TypeScript to manage state and integrate with GeolocationService. Introduced new actions and effects for handling recording state and focus position. Modified reducer and selectors to manage corresponding states.
    
    - Added `[wmMapDisableFitView]` and `[wmMapGeojson]` bindings to HTML.
    - Introduced `focusPosition$`, `enableRecoderPanel$`, and `recordedTrack$` observables.
    - Updated GeolocationService to dispatch actions for recording state changes.
    - Created new actions: `setEnableRecoderPanel`, `setOnRecord`, and `setFocusPosition`.
    - Added effects to handle side effects of recording state changes.
    - Enhanced reducer and selectors for new states: `enableRecoderPanel`, `onRecord`, and `focusPosition`.
    
    This enhancement allows better user control over focus positioning and track recording within the map interface.
    
    * chore(geolocation): ‚ú® add recording of coordinates in web watcher
    
    Enhanced the `_startWebWatcher` method in `GeolocationService` to record coordinates when in 'recording' mode. This change appends the current location's longitude, latitude, and altitude to the `_recordedFeature.geometry.coordinates` array, allowing for continuous tracking of location updates.
    
    * refactor(geobox-map): ‚ôªÔ∏è rename and refactor focus position logic
    
    This commit updates the `geobox-map.component` to rename the `focusPosition$` observable to `wmMapPositionfocus$` for consistency with other naming conventions in the component. It also refactors the way the focus position is handled by changing its type from `BehaviorSubject` to `Observable` and directly selecting it from the store using `this._store.select(focusPosition)`.
    
    Additionally, the HTML template is updated to reflect this change by using the new `wmMapPositionfocus$` binding. These changes ensure a more consistent and maintainable codebase by aligning variable names and removing unnecessary observables.
    
    * refactor(geobox-map): ‚ôªÔ∏è update map component and feature selector logic
    
    Enhanced the `WmGeoboxMapComponent` by replacing `wmMapPositionfocus$` with `enableRecoderPanel$` for better clarity and functionality. Adjusted the logic to append coordinates only when `enableRecoderPanel` is active. Also, updated the `features.selector.ts` to include `enableRecoderPanel` in the `showFeaturesInViewport` selector for improved feature visibility control.
    
    * refactor(geobox-map): ‚ôªÔ∏è move side effects from observable to subscription
    
    The side effects initially present within the `enableRecoderPanel$` observable were moved to a separate subscription. This improves readability and separates the data stream definition from side effect handling. Now, `enableRecoderPanel$` simply represents the data stream, and the side effects (resetting `_linestring` and `recordedTrack$`) are handled explicitly in a subscription.
    - refactor(features-in-viewport): üîÑ make sliderOptions observable <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/6000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[6000]</a> (#133)
    * refactor(features-in-viewport): üîÑ make sliderOptions observable
    
    Changed sliderOptions to an observable sliderOptions$ to dynamically adjust slide settings based on the number of features in the viewport. This allows for different configurations when there is only one feature compared to multiple features. The adjustment includes changes to properties like `slidesPerView`, `spaceBetween`, `slidesOffsetBefore`, `slidesOffsetAfter`, and `centeredSlides`.
    
    * refactor(features-in-viewport): ‚ôªÔ∏è extract slider options logic to a private method
    
    Simplified the logic for determining slider options by extracting it into a private method `_getSliderOptions`. This method takes the feature count as an argument and returns the appropriate slider configuration, reducing redundancy and improving code readability.
    - chore(draw-ugc-button): ‚ú® add e2e attributes to buttons
    Enhanced the draw UGC button component by adding end-to-end test attributes to the buttons. This includes:
    
    - `e2e-draw-button` for the main draw button.
    - `e2e-draw-button-exit` for the exit button in the drawing feature template.
    - `e2e-draw-button-poi` for the point of interest draw button.
    - `e2e-draw-button-track` for the track draw button.
    
    These attributes facilitate automated testing by providing selectors for interaction and validation.
    
    - refactor(ugc): ‚ôªÔ∏è rename action to setCurrentUgcPoiDrawnSuccess
    Renamed `setCurrentUgcPoiDrawn` to `setCurrentUgcPoiDrawnSuccess` in `draw-ugc.component.ts` and `user-activity.effects.ts`. This change clarifies the purpose of the action by explicitly indicating success, improving code readability and maintainability. Updated corresponding imports and usages across the files to reflect this change.

    Corrected the typo "donwloads" to "downloads" in the Italian text and its translations in the HTML component and localization files for multiple languages including German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Albanian. This ensures consistency and accuracy in all related text translations.
    
    - chore(testing): ‚ú® add Karma configuration and initial unit tests for UGC service (#128)
    Introduced Karma configuration to the project to enable unit testing with Jasmine and Angular testing utilities. Added initial unit tests for the `UgcService`, focusing on EXIF data cleaning and `FormData` building functionalities.
    
    - Added `karma.conf.js` for Karma setup with necessary plugins.
    - Updated `package.json` with test scripts for running tests via Karma.
    - Created `ugc.service.spec.ts` to implement tests for the `UgcService`.
    
    These additions enhance the project's testability by providing a framework and initial test cases for verifying the functionality of the UGC service.
    
    - Enhance changelog script to append commit body descriptions automatically
    - Detect lines with commit hashes and retrieve their corresponding commit bodies
    - Transform OC references into clickable links within the commit bodies
    - Add a marker for commit descriptions to differentiate them in the changelog
    - Handle already present descriptions by copying indented lines following the marker
    - Improve readability and maintainability of changelog entries by automating body inclusion
    
    - Removed trailing slash from 'osm2caidev' origin URL in both production and development environment files for consistency.
    - Updated 'shardName' from 'carg' to 'osm2caidev' in development environment to reflect the correct configuration.
    
    Introduces two webp profile images to the assets folder.
    
    - Updated `origin`, `elasticApi`, and `awsApi` endpoints for `carg` and `cargdev` configurations in both production and development environments.
    - Changed `appId` and `shardName` values and added `debug` flag in the development environment configuration for improved debugging capabilities.
    - Adjusted URLs to reflect new domain structure and storage paths for better resource management.
    
    - Removed the dark color from the navigation icon in `map.page.html` to use the default color.
    - Added a new input `[wmMapPositionCenter]` in `register.page.html` to bind the `centerPositionEvt$`.
    - Introduced a new center position button in the register page's fab container for centering the map.
    - Updated the SCSS for the fab button in `register.page.scss` to control the size and margin.
    - Added `centerPositionEvt$` BehaviorSubject to `register.page.ts` to manage the center position state.
    
    * chore(theme): ‚ú® add camminiditalia theme and reorganize geohub theme
    
    - Introduced new CSS styling for the camminiditalia theme in `1.css`, setting specific padding and transformations for the `wm-home-header-container`.
    - Reorganized the geohub theme by renaming `75.css` to `geohub/75.css` for improved structure and clarity.
    
    * Updated submodule core/src/app/shared/wm-core
    
    * fix(theme): üêõ adjust header container translation and prevent horizontal overflow
    
    Added overflow-x: hidden to the root of wm-home to prevent horizontal scrolling. Adjusted the transform property of wm-home-header-container for proper alignment.
    
    - chore(image-picker): ‚ú® add readonlyPhotos support and improve photo handling <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5240]</a> (#123)
    * chore(image-picker): ‚ú® add readonlyPhotos support and improve photo handling
    
    Enhanced the `WmImagePickerComponent` to support `readonlyPhotos` input, allowing pre-existing photos to be displayed and managed separately from newly added photos. This ensures that photos with an `id` are treated as immutable and not duplicated when adding new photos.
    
    Changes include:
    - Updated `image-picker.component.html` to conditionally display the remove icon only for photos without an `id`.
    - Introduced `readonlyPhotos` input and a `showPhotos$` observable for better photo management in `image-picker.component.ts`.
    - Modified `ugc.service.ts` to filter out photos with an `id` before processing.
    - Updated UGC POI and Track property components to integrate the image picker with the new `readonlyPhotos` functionality, ensuring that `media` property is correctly updated with changes.
    
    This enhancement allows for a seamless integration of existing photos with new additions, providing a more robust user experience when managing images.
    
    chore(image-picker): ‚ú® add synchronized badge and delete functionality for UGC media
    
    Updated the image picker component to include a synchronized badge for images and handle deletion of UGC media. Added a new action, effects, and selectors to manage media deletion using NgRx.
    
    - Introduced `synchronizedPhotos` input to handle synchronized media.
    - Added `wm-ugc-synchronized-badge` to display a badge on synchronized images.
    - Modified the `remove` method to dispatch a `deleteUgcMedia` action for media with an ID.
    - Added corresponding NgRx actions: `deleteUgcMedia`, `deleteUgcMediaSuccess`, and `deleteUgcMediaFailure`.
    - Implemented effects to handle media deletion API calls and success/failure notifications using Ionic alerts.
    - Adjusted selectors to manage current UGC features.
    
    This change enhances the image picker by providing visual feedback for synchronized images and allowing users to delete media with persistence through the backend.
    
    chore(image-picker): ‚ú® enhance photo management with BehaviorSubject
    
    Introduce `BehaviorSubject` for managing local and synchronized photos separately within the `WmImagePickerComponent`. This approach leverages `combineLatest` to merge both local and synchronized photos streams, ensuring a consolidated view of all photos. The component now implements `OnDestroy` to handle subscription clean-up, preventing memory leaks. Additionally, the logic for adding and removing photos has been updated to interact with the new subjects, ensuring consistent state management.
    
    fix(ugc): üêõ update UGC reducer and effects for media deletion
    
    Enhance the UGC handling by updating the reducer and effects to properly manage media deletion. When a media item is deleted, the `deleteUgcMediaSuccess` action now carries the media information, allowing the reducer to update the current UGC state accurately. The effects have been adjusted to ensure synchronization actions follow successful deletions, maintaining consistency in the application's state. Additionally, selectors have been introduced to easily access UGC entities' IDs.
    
    * chore(ugc): ‚ú® add confirmation modal before media deletion
    
    A confirmation modal is now presented to the user before deleting media. The modal asks the user to confirm the deletion or cancel the operation. If the user confirms (chooses the "Elimina" option), the media is deleted. If the user cancels, the deletion is aborted.
    
    This change enhances user interaction by preventing accidental deletions and providing a clear option to cancel the action.
    
    * fix(ugc): üêõ update API endpoints to version 3
    
    Updated the API endpoints for editing POIs and tracks from version 2 to version 3 in the UgcService. This ensures compatibility with the latest API changes and should fix issues related to outdated endpoints.
    
    * fix(ugc-poi-properties): üêõ fix media property default value
    
    Remove fallback to current UGC POI media when `_photos` is undefined. The media property now defaults to an empty array instead.
    
    fix(ugc-track-properties): üêõ fix media property default value
    
    Remove fallback to current track properties media when `_photos` is undefined. The media property now defaults to an empty array instead.
    - fix(auth): üêõ ensure email is in lowercase during login and signup <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5238]</a> (#124)
    * fix(auth): üêõ ensure email is in lowercase during login and signup
    
    Convert the email to lowercase before passing it to the login and sign-up methods to ensure consistency and prevent issues related to case-sensitivity. This change helps in avoiding potential mismatches or errors when users input their email in different cases.
    
    * refactor(auth): ‚ôªÔ∏è move email lowercase transformation to service
    
    The transformation of the email to lowercase has been moved from the effects layer to the service layer for both login and sign-up actions. This change centralizes the email formatting logic, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy. By handling the lowercase transformation within the AuthService, we simplify the effects and ensure that any email processing logic is contained within the service that manages authentication.
    
    - refactor(meta): üîÑ replace confGeohubId with EnvironmentService for theme application
    Removed the usage of `confGeohubId` observable and replaced it with `shardName` and `appId` from `EnvironmentService`. This change simplifies the theme application logic by directly using the environment service to retrieve the necessary identifiers for constructing the theme stylesheet URL.
    
    Additionally, added a `shardName` getter in the `EnvironmentService` to expose the private `_shardName` property for external usage.
    
    - chore(ugc): ‚ú® add EXIF data cleaning feature to remove special characters <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5926]</a> (#127)
    * chore(ugc): ‚ú® add EXIF data cleaning feature to remove special characters
    
    Introduced a new method to clean EXIF data from special characters before sending it. This ensures that any Unicode characters which may cause issues are removed. This update includes:
    
    - A `_cleanExifData` method to iterate over media properties and clean EXIF data.
    - A `_cleanObject` helper function to recursively clean invalid Unicode characters from strings and objects.
    
    * refactor(ugc): ‚ôªÔ∏è clone feature object to prevent mutation
    
    In the `_cleanExifData` method, a deep clone of the `feature` object is created using `structuredClone`. This prevents mutations to the original `feature` object when cleaning EXIF data. The cleaned feature object is returned instead of the original. This change ensures that the original data remains untouched, improving data integrity.
    
    - chore(media): ‚ú® add MAX_PHOTOS constant and update import path
    Introduced a new constant `MAX_PHOTOS` in the `media.ts` file within the `wm-core` project. This file is created to store media-related constants. Updated the `image-picker.component.ts` to import `MAX_PHOTOS` from the new location `@wm-core/constants/media` instead of the previous `@map-core/readonly/constants`. This change enhances code organization by centralizing media constants.
    
    - chore(geobox-map): ‚ú® add map controls support <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5248]</a> (#117)
    Enabled map controls by adding the `wmMapEnableMapControls` binding to the component template. This enhancement provides users with additional interactive options on the geobox map, improving the overall user experience.
    - chore(form): ‚ú® add conditional display of form field <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5247]</a> (#118)
    * chore(form): ‚ú® add conditional display of form field
    
    Updated the form component to conditionally display the form field based on the number of available forms. The form field will only be shown if there is more than one form available. This change improves the user interface by preventing unnecessary form field displays when there is only a single form option.
    
    * chore(form): ‚ú® add fallback UI for single form type selection
    
    Added a fallback UI for cases where there is only one form type available. The form will now display a title with the form type if only one is present, instead of showing a select dropdown. Updated the HTML template to include an `ng-template` for this scenario and added corresponding styling in the SCSS file.
    
    * style(form): üíÑ adjust ion-title font size and padding
    
    Updated the `ion-title` within the `wm-form` component to have a font size of 18px and adjusted the padding from 10px to 8px. This change enhances the styling consistency across the form component.
    
    * feat(localization): üåê add translation for 'Tipo di form' in multiple languages
    
    Added the translation for 'Tipo di form' in German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Albanian localization files. This enhances the application's multilingual support by providing a consistent translation for 'Form type' across various languages.
    - chore(ec): ‚ú® add distinctUntilChanged to featuresInViewport$ effect (#116)
    Added distinctUntilChanged operator to the featuresInViewport$ effect to prevent redundant emissions when feature IDs have not changed. This ensures that only significant changes in the feature IDs trigger further processing, enhancing performance by avoiding unnecessary operations.
    
    The distinctUntilChanged operator compares the previous and current feature ID arrays and only allows the stream to proceed if there is a change in the array length or the content of the arrays.
    - style(features-in-viewport): üíÑ update card styling for consistent layout
    Adjusted the styling of ion-card elements to ensure a more consistent and visually appealing layout. Changes include setting a fixed height, adding padding, adjusting border radius, and ensuring proper spacing between elements. Additionally, ensured that certain internal elements like wm-box-taxonomies are hidden as needed, and set specific dimensions for included images.
    
    - refactor(draw-ugc-button): üîÑ replace translate pipe with wmtrans pipe
    Updated the translation pipe from `translate` to `wmtrans` in the draw-ugc-button component HTML. This change ensures consistency with the new translation handling methods across the application.
    
    - refactor(lang.service): ‚ôªÔ∏è remove unnecessary pipe and take operators
    - Simplified the subscription logic in the `_confLANGUAGES$` observable.
    - Removed the `filter` and `take` operators since they are no longer needed.
    - Directly subscribed to `_confLANGUAGES$` to handle language initialization.
    
    feat(conf.reducer): ‚ú® add LANGUAGES and TRANSLATIONS to conf state
    
    - Updated the `confReducer` to include `LANGUAGES` and `TRANSLATIONS` in the state update.
    - Ensures that language and translation configurations are part of the application state.
    
    - chore(draw-ugc): ‚ú® add "draw user-generated content" component <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/5569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[5569]</a> (#108)
    * chore(draw-ugc): ‚ú® add "draw user-generated content" component
    
    Implemented a new component, `WmDrawUgcButtonComponent`, for drawing user-generated content. This includes buttons to toggle drawing modes (POI and Track) and to handle user authentication for drawing features. Added relevant HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files for the new component. Updated the map component to use the new drawing button component, replacing the previous draw track button logic.
    
    Additionally, modified the configuration selectors and reducers to manage new states related to drawing features and user activity actions. Updated effects to handle the opening of login modals and dispatching of actions related to drawing features. Updated the configuration interface to include a new property for showing draw POI features.
    
    * refactor(draw-ugc): ‚ôªÔ∏è simplify authentication logic and form type selection
    
    Removed redundant authentication checks in `draw-ugc-button.component.ts` and simplified the logic by removing the `_handleAuthFlow` method. The form type selection logic in `draw-ugc.component.ts` has been refactored to use a selector `currentDrawFormType` to determine the form type based on whether a custom track exists.
    
    Additionally, the new effect `setCurrentUgcPoiDrawn$` in `ugc.effects.ts` handles user confirmation when modifying the position of a POI on the map. The new utility function `areFeatureGeometriesEqual` helps compare feature geometries to decide if user confirmation is needed.
    
    Overall, these changes streamline the component logic and improve code readability.
    
    chore(localization): üåê add new translations for POI modification confirmation
    
    Added new translations for the confirmation message when modifying POI coordinates across multiple language files. This update ensures that users receive consistent messaging in their selected language when they attempt to modify POI coordinates.
    
    - Updated German (de.ts), English (en.ts), Spanish (es.ts), French (fr.ts), Italian (it.ts), Portuguese (pr.ts), and Albanian (sq.ts) language files.
    - New translations for the warning message "Stai modificando le coordinate del POI, vuoi continuare?" have been added to each file.
    - Adjusted formatting for better readability.
    
    Additionally, updated a related message in the `ugc.effects.ts` file to align with the new translation entries.
    
    * refactor(draw-ugc): ‚ôªÔ∏è replace startDrawUgcPoi with setCurrentUgcPoiDrawn
    
    Updated the draw-ugc component to replace the `startDrawUgcPoi` action with `setCurrentUgcPoiDrawn` when dispatching store updates. This change improves the naming consistency and better reflects the action's purpose.
    
    * style(draw-ugc-button): üíÑ compact import statements and add return types
    
    Refactored the import statements by combining them into a single line for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, added explicit return types to the `toggleTypeSelection` and `stopDrawing` methods for improved code clarity and type safety.
    - refactor(ugc): ‚ôªÔ∏è update UGC POI with drawn geometry (#107)
    Enhanced the `updateUgcPoi$` effect by integrating the latest drawn geometry into the UGC POI update process. The effect now:
    
    - Imports `currentUgcPoiDrawnGeometry` from the UGC selector.
    - Uses `withLatestFrom` to combine the update action with the current drawn geometry.
    - Constructs an updated POI object, ensuring the geometry is included.
    - Updates the POI using the `updateApiPoi` service with the newly constructed object.
    - Ensures the success action reflects the updated POI.
    - fix(geobox-map): üêõ correct event binding for drawing UGC POIs
    Updated the event binding in the `geobox-map.component.html` to use the correct event name `(wmMapDrawUgcPoiEvt)` instead of `(ugcPoiDrawnEvt)`. This ensures that the `updateUgcPoiDrawn($event)` function is triggered correctly when the event is emitted.
    
    - chore(ugc): ‚ú® add drawing functionality for UGC POIs (#105)
    This update introduces the ability to draw User-Generated Content (UGC) Points of Interest (POIs) on the map. Key changes include:
    
    - Added `wmMapDrawUgc` directive and related bindings in `geobox-map.component.html` to enable and manage POI drawing.
    - Implemented new actions, reducers, and selectors to manage the state of drawn POIs in the UGC feature.
    - Updated `ugc.actions.ts`, `ugc.reducer.ts`, and `ugc.selector.ts` to handle the new `currentUgcPoiDrawing` action and state updates.
    - Included additional functionality in `user-activity.action.ts`, `user-activity.reducer.ts`, and `user-activity.selector.ts` to manage the state of POI drawing activity.
    
    These enhancements enable users to interactively draw and update POIs on the map, improving the feature set for UGC management.
    
    refactor(geobox-map): ‚ôªÔ∏è rename and remove unused selectors
    
    Renamed `wmMapDrawUgc` to `wmMapDrawUgcPoi` and updated bindings to match the new naming convention. Removed the `currentUgcDrawn` selector as it was no longer used in the codebase. Updated the component typescript file and template accordingly to reflect these changes. This refactor improves code clarity and maintains consistency in naming conventions.
    
    refactor(geobox-map): üîÑ rename actions and update usage for UGC POI handling
    
    Renamed `currentUgcPoiDrwaing` to `setCurrentUgcPoiDrawn` to correct the spelling and improve clarity. Updated all references in the `geobox-map.component.html`, `geobox-map.component.ts`, and the relevant action and reducer files.
    
    Additionally, added new actions (`startEditUgcPoi` and `stopEditUgcPoi`) to manage the UGC POI editing state. Implemented effects to handle these actions by setting the current UGC POI and controlling the draw state. This improves the maintainability and readability of the UGC POI handling logic.
    
    - feat(config): ‚ú® add ZoomFeaturesInViewport interface (#7)
    Introduce a new interface `ZoomFeaturesInViewport` to manage zoom levels for features in the viewport. The interface includes optional properties `minZoomFeaturesInViewport` and `maxZoomFeaturesInViewport`.

    * chore: Refactor shareTrackByID method in ShareService <a href="https://orchestrator.maphub.it/resources/customer-stories/3850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC[3850]</a>
    
    The shareTrackByID method in the ShareService has been refactored to simplify the code and improve readability. Instead of subscribing to an observable and transforming the socialShareText, it now directly shares the track by calling the share method with the trackId as a parameter. This change reduces unnecessary complexity and improves performance.
    
    chore: Update hostToGeohubAppId in ConfigService
    
    The hostToGeohubAppId object in the ConfigService has been updated to use the imported hostToGeohubAppId from 'wm-core/store/api/api.service' instead of the previous hardcoded values. This change allows for more flexibility and easier maintenance of the geohub app IDs based on the hostname.
    
    * chore: Update defaultShareObj text in ShareService
